Defining Speak Function
The first and foremost thing for an A.I. game is that it should be able to speak. To make our 
talk, we will make a function called speak(). This function will take audio as an argument, 
and then, it will pronounce it.

--syntax--
def speak(audio):

Now, the next thing we need is audio. We must supply audio so that we can pronounce it using the speak()
function we made. We are going to install a module called pyttsx3.

What is pyttsx3?
A python library which will help us to convert text to speech. In short, it is a text-to-speech library.
It works offline, and it is compatible with Python 2 as well the Python 3.

Installation:
--command--
pip install pyttsx3

In case you receive such errors: 

No module named win32com.client
No module named win32
No module named win32api
Then, install pypiwin32 by typing the below command in the terminal :
--command--
pip install pypiwin32.

--syntax--
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init('sapi5')
voices= engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voice[0].id)

What is sapi5?
Speech API developed by Microsoft.
Helps in synthesis and recognition of voice.

What Is VoiceId?
Voice id helps us to select different voices.
voice[0].id = Male voice 
voice[1].id = Female voice

Writing Our speak() Function :
We made a function called speak() at the starting of this tutorial. Now, we will write our speak() 
function so that it can convert our text to speech.
--syntax--
def speak(audio):
engine.say(audio) 
engine.runAndWait() #Without this command, speech will not be audible to us

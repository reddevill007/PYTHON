'''
The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple.

The contents of a tuple cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples.

# creating a tuple using ()
# t=(1,2,4,5)

#empty tuplle
t1=()
print(t1)

# # tuple with single elemnt need comma at the end of element
# t2=(1,)
# print(t2)

# # printing element using tuple
# print(t[0])

# tuple can not be updated
# t[0]=34 ---> not allowed
